				<h2>Unlock your <strong>SaaS data</strong></h2>
				<p>Your data lives with the SaaS provider. That means you rely on them to make sure you can easily access and understand your data — and you rely on them to come up with cool AI features that can extract insights for you. Clairify connects natural language prompts to your SaaS REST APIs which means that you can start using power of AI right now to investigate the ‘why’ behind your metrics.</p>

				<h2><strong>Answers</strong> Not Reports</h2>
				<p>As your business grows, so does the number of SaaS apps you use. This means that the complete picture of your business is spread across all of those apps, leading you down the road of manual download, consolidation, and reporting. Clairify is like a data mart just for you, giving you all the power of a unified data model without the drudgery.</p>

				<h2>Less <strong>Cognitive Load</strong></h2>
				<p>You are an owner, project manager, sales rep, accountant, HR, and technician. Nearly every unit of work in each of those areas will span days or weeks. All that WIP means that you are constantly asking for, looking up, remembering, or note-taking about something. Instead, treat your brain like it only has 512KB and offload the rest to Clairify.</p>

					<p class="editable">Owning an MSP often means flying by the seat of your pants. It’s a chore maintain an up-to-date understanding of who did what work, when, and for whom. This is particularly true when the information I need is spread across multiple SaaS apps. We are building Clairify to be an executive co-pilot — a single place where can go to ask any question about your business — so that MSP owners can reduce their cognitive load and make informed operational decisions faster.</p>
