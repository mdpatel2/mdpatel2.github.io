				<h2>Unlock your <strong>SaaS data</strong></h2>
				<p>Your data lives with the SaaS provider. That means you rely on them to make sure you can easily access and understand your data — and you rely on them to come up with cool AI features that can extract insights for you. Clairify connects natural language prompts to your SaaS REST APIs so that you can start using AI right now to get the ‘why’ behind your metrics.</p>

				<h2><strong>Answers</strong> Not Reports</h2>
				<p>As your business grows, so does the number of SaaS apps you use. This means that the complete picture of your business is spread across all of those apps, leading you down the road of manual download, consolidation, and reporting. Clairify is like a data mart just for you, giving you the power of a unified data model without the drudgery.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text editable">
				<h2>Less <strong>Cognitive Load</strong></h2>
				<p>You are an owner, project manager, sales rep, accountant, HR, and technician. Nearly every unit of work in each of those areas will span days or weeks. All that WIP means that you are constantly asking for, looking up, remembering, or note-taking about something. Instead, treat your brain like it has 512KB and rely on Clairify for the rest.</p>

					<p class="editable">Owning an MSP often means flying by the seat of your pants. As your team grows, it gets harder and harder to maintain an up-to-date understanding of who did what work, when, and for whom. We're building Clairify to be an executive co-pilot — a single place to get answers about your business — so that MSP owners can reduce their cognitive load and make informed decisions faster.</p>
