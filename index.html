				<h2>Reduce <strong>cognitive load</strong></h2>
				<p>You're an owner, project manager, sales rep, accountant, HR, and technician. Nearly every unit of work in each of those arenas spans days or weeks. All that WIP means that you are constantly asking for, looking up, remembering, or note-taking about something. With Clairify, there’s no runaround &mdash; the information or memory refresh you need is right at your fingertips.</p>

				<h2><strong>Unlock</strong> your SaaS data</h2>
				<p>Your data lives with your SaaS providers. That means you rely on them data features like reporting, dashboards, and AI assistants (that are never quite right). Clairify maps natural language to your SaaS REST APIs, use the power of GPTs right now to investigate the ‘why’ behind your metrics.</p>

				<h2>Many apps <strong>one interface</strong></h2>
				<p>As your business grows, so does the number of SaaS apps you use. This means that the complete picture of your business is spread across all of those apps, leading you down the road of manual data downloads, consolidation, and reporting. We’ve all been there. Clairify gives you the ask-me-anything experience across vendors as if you had a unified data model.</p>

					<p class="editable">Owning an MSP often means flying by the seat of your pants. It’s a lot of leg work to maintain an up-to-date understanding of who did what work, when, and for whom. This is particularly true when the information I need is spread across multiple SaaS apps. We're building Clairify to be an executive co-pilot — a single place to ask any question about your business — so that MSP owners can reduce their cognitive load and make informed operational decisions faster.</p>
