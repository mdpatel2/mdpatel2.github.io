					<p class="editable">Owning an MSP often means flying by the seat of your pants. As your team grows, it gets harder and harder to maintain an up-to-date understanding of who did what work, when, and for whom. We're building Clairify to be an executive co-pilot — a single place to get answers about your business — so that MSP owners can reduce their cognitive load and make informed decisions faster.</p>
